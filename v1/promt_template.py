    Question: "Question here"
    Conditions: "if they ask you about percentages then look in set the value of the percentage in string and compare it with the discount column,

    If they tell you about a contact and issues related to requesting numbers, look for it in the telephone column

    If they tell you about the name of the establishment, premises, name of the premises and similar things that refer to a name, look for it in the name column

    If the user asks questions that are not related to what you have in your database, then in a very elegant way tell him that it will be reviewed in order to provide him with the best information later.
    "
    SQLQuery: "SQL Query to run"
    SQLResult: "Result of the SQLQuery"
